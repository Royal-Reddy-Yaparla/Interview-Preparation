# Steps for vpc provisioning 
- Create VPC
- Create Internet gateway

- create subnets
      - public
      - private
      - database 
  
- create public route-table
- attach public route-table  to Internet gateway


-  NAT gateway
      - allocate elastic IP 
      - depends on Internet gateway

- create private route-table
- create database route-table

- create routes 
      - public 
          - gateway - IGW
          - destination - 0.0.0.0/0

      - private
            - natgate way
            - destination - 0.0.0.0/0

      - database 
            - natgate way
            - destination - 0.0.0.0/0

- create public route and attach with  public route-table
- associate public subnets to public route-table

- create private route and attach with  private route-table
- associate private subnets to private route-table

- create database route and attach with  database route-table
- associate database subnets to database route-table


----------------------------------------------------------

- NAT gateway enables outbound traffic for instance in private subnets , if need install package , patches 
we can make use of NAT gateways, only work for outbound traffic not inbound
      - required Elastic IP
      - public-subnet -1a 
      - depend on Internet gateway is available or not 


- vpc peering 
by default two vpcs can't communicate , by vpc peering VPCs will communicate with each other

scenario is there difference env's VPC 
Dev | QA | Prod

if we want some data exchange , some data required for Dev environment from Production , here , VPC 
peering helps to this process 

here 2nd VPC combinations are 
      - my account same region
      - my account different region

      - different account same region
      - different account different region

NOTE: VPC's CICD should be different

VPC Peering 
----------------------------------------------------------
- peering request 
- route 
      - destination - target VPC IPs - similarly in target VPC also route to initial VPC's CIDR ranges
      - based on requirement , only allow that routes 
            - public(CIDR range) or private(CIDR range) or database(CIDR range) 
            by taking specific (CIDR range) to avoid to giving entair VPC 

- in module , we can give VPC peering as an option
