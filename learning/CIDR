VPC

CIDR= Classless Inter-Domain Routing, a method for allocating IP addresses and routing traffic more efficiently on the internet.

IPV4 allows - 32 bit

2^32 = 32 bit = 255.255.255.255 = 2^8 * 2^8 * 2^8 * 2^8 = 4,29,49,67,296 servers = 426cr 
2^24 = 24 bit = (blocked-for-network).255.255.255 = 2^8 * 2^8 *  2^8 = 1,67,77,216 servers = 1cr 
2^16 = 16 bit = (blocked-for-network).(blocked-for-network).255.255 = 2^8 * 2^8 = 65,536 servers = 65k
2^8  =  8 bit  = (blocked-for-network).(blocked-for-network).(blocked-for-network).255 = 2^8 = 256 servers

2^20 = 20bits means for network reserved in 32 bit , remaining 12 bit for servers so
2^12 for servers = 2^8 + 2^4 = 256 + 16 = 272 servers

for example 
2^16 = 16 bit =  65,536 servers

in aws CIDR size between /16 and /28max
so by taking max , won't be charged for that 

0.0.0.0/0 is internet notation.

private subnet ranges
------------------------------------------------------------------
- 10.0.0.0/8 - 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 and is commonly used for large networks. 
- 172.16.0.0/12 - 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 and is suitable for medium-sized networks. 
- 192.168.0.0/16 - 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 and is commonly used for smaller networks like home networks.
