In Kubernetes, by default, a pod has no resource limits, meaning it can use as much CPU and memory as available on the node — potentially affecting other pods.

To control this, we can define resource requests and limits in the pod's spec:

Requests act as a soft guarantee — the scheduler uses these values to decide where to place the pod.

Limits are hard caps — the pod cannot use more than the specified CPU or memory.

    kubectl top pods
