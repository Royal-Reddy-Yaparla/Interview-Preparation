A Deployment in Kubernetes manages ReplicaSets and Pods and provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. It supports rolling updates and rollbacks, ensuring zero-downtime deployments and easy recovery from failures.




```
    kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
    kubectl rollout status deployment /<deployment_name>
```
