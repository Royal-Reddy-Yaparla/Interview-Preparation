When managing multiple environments like DEV, UAT, and PROD, using separate *.tfvars files allows us to customize configurations (like instance type, region, tags, etc.) per environment.

In this approach, we also use a separate backend configuration for each environment — to store state in different remote locations (e.g., separate S3 buckets or folders) — so that DEV and PROD do not interfere with each other.

This approach works well for small to mid-sized projects. However, for larger environments or when managing many environments, constantly reconfiguring the backend can become repetitive and error-prone.



- switch to DEV and provisioning
terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=DEV/backend.tfbackend
terraform apply -var-file=DEV/terraform.tfvars -auto-approve

- switch to PROD and provisioning
terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=PROD/backend.tfbackend
terraform apply -var-file=PROD/terraform.tfvars -auto-approve
