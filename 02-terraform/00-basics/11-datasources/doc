In Terraform, we can use built-in functions, but we cannot create custom functions.
Functions are used to perform specific tasks like working with strings, numbers, lists, maps, etc.

examples
length() → Returns the length of a list or string
max() → Returns the maximum value among the inputs
min() → Returns the minimum value among the inputs

to check sample fucntion by terraform we can do by command

terraform cosole
>> max(2, 5, 6)
output would be 6 

we can find function from documentation based on requirement.
