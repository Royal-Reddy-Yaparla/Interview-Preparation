datasource allows us to quiry and fetch info from providers(Like AWS) this info is read only and can be input for 
creating / configuring other resources

Retrieving an AMI ID dynamically by passing filters to the AWS provider

remember: 
data-sources:
    - to read info from existing infrastructure - which is not created by terraform like outside terraform
        ex: ami_ids, VPC(default), subnet.
    -  it is not created , only read-only 

Attribute Reference (from resource)
    - fetch info from resouces those are created by terraform , here quiry info not exist , it will be created.
    - ex: passing security group id to ec2 resouce etc
