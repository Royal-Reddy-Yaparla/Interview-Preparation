locals allow us to store the values those 
are involve with login , expression , fucnctions and values.

but in variables we cant call variable in another 
variables, 

similary between them is 

those two are passing values , but compare 
to varables , locals supports the expression, fucnctions 

the point is we can't override the locals
like variables 


variables are external , passed by the user

but locals are Internal values, used within Terraform code only

Often depend on variables, expressions, or other logic

Cannot be overridden externally

Used to avoid duplication and simplify logic
