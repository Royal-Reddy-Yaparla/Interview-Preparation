When updating a resource in Terraform, if the resource is immutable (cannot be modified in place), Terraform destroys and re-creates it.

However, if this resource is a dependency for other resources, destroying it may not be allowed or could cause downstream failures.

Thatâ€™s where the lifecycle block helps you manage how Terraform handles changes, especially in critical or interdependent infrastructure.

lifecycle {
  prevent_destroy      = true
  create_before_destroy = true
  ignore_changes        = [tags]
}


1. prevent_destroy = true
Prevents the resource from being destroyed under any circumstance.
Useful for critical resources like production databases or S3 buckets with data.

2. create_before_destroy = true
Ensures the new resource is created before the old one is destroyed.
Essential when dealing with immutable infrastructure like AWS IAM roles, Load Balancers, or DNS records.

3. ignore_changes = [...]
Instructs Terraform to ignore specific changes in the resource (like tags), avoiding unnecessary updates.
