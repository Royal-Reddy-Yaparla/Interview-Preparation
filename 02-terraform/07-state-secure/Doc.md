follow steps , allow us to maintain terraform state with secure , apt to production 

1. ```remote-state storage```: store the `terraform.tfstate` file in s3 bucket to ensure centralizes and consistency across all the team members , to avoid local state issues and enable collaboration.

2. ```state-locking```: avoid parallel infrastructure-changes , by enabling the state locking.
    - with dynamodb or s3 native lock

3. ```Dedicated execution environment```: Terraform operations are performed from a dedicated EC2 instance with terraform configuration or a CI/CD runner (like Jenkins).
This environment is configured with the required IAM role that has limited access to only the necessary AWS services.

4. ```Encryption and Versioning```:  The S3 bucket is configured with
    - Server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) to protect state at rest.

    - Versioning, so if someone accidentally overwrites or corrupts the state, we can roll back to an earlier version.
5. ```Access control```: apply strict IAM and bucket policies to ensure:

    - Only specific roles (like TerraformAdmin) can access or update the state.

    - No one except the root/admin can delete the state file — this prevents accidental or unauthorized deletion.

    ```

6.  ```Backup & Replication```: To ensure disaster recovery, we set up S3 Cross-Region Replication.
This keeps a copy of the state in another region in case of regional failure or data loss.

---
In production,  store Terraform state remotely in an S3 bucket with versioning and encryption enabled.

use DynamoDB or native S3 locking to prevent concurrent updates. 

Only a dedicated Terraform instance or CI pipeline with limited IAM roles can read or write the state. 

also restrict delete access — only the root or admin can delete the state file. For backup, 
  
enable cross-region replication. This setup ensures secure, consistent, and auditable infrastructure changes.
