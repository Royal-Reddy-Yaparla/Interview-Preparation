USER is used in a Dockerfile to specify the user the container should run as from that point onward.

By default, Docker containers run as root, which can pose security risks (e.g., privilege escalation, tampering with host or other containers).

It's a best practice to create and switch to a non-root user for better isolation and security.

Prevents accidental changes to the host or other containers.

Enforces principle of least privilege.

Some platforms (like OpenShift) require containers to run as non-root.
