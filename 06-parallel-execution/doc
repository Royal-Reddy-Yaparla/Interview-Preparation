- here we can say to ansible to take config_file , based on requirent , if user wants to use custom config file we can maintain the .ansible.cfg , where we want to implement playbooks.

- here ansible taking .ansible.cfg like below 
  1. Environment_variables: export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=<location>
  2. current directory: if we specified in current directory 
  3. user_home_directory: 
  4. default: /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

- perfer: current directory , and like hidden file
