here we need copy private key in ansible-master and save that laction in ansible-cfg like bello then asnible
master connects nodes and excutes configuration 

The private key (e.g., ssh-testing.pem) must be accessible on the control node, and its path is typically set in ansible.cfg under private_key_file to enable SSH authentication.

The corresponding public key must be added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on each managed node for the specified remote_user (e.g., ec2-user). This allows passwordless SSH access.

ansible.cfg
[defaults]
inventory= inventory.yaml
remote_user= ec2-user 
private_key_file=/home/ec2-user/ssh-testing.pem

[ssh_connection]
pipelining = True

pipelining = True reduces SSH round-trips, speeding up execution.

Private Key Permissions:
chmod 400 /home/ec2-user/ssh-testing.pem 

check ssh connection 
ssh -i /home/ec2-user/ssh-testing.pem ec2-user@<node-ip>
SSH connectivity (port 22 open) between the control node and managed nodes.
